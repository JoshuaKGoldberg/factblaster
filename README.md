FactBlaster: the best worst way to tick off your friends!

#What is FactBlaster?

FactBlaster is a project born of prank revenge.  Almost all telcoms have an SMS "gateway", where delivering emails to a certain address will send them as SMS messages to a number.  This project, originally designed for a Raspberry Pi, makes use of these gateways and SSMTP for a truly delightful Fun Facts service.  Currently the program supports reading from a specific file of names and addresses and a single direct command-line usage.  Future plans including using configuration files and including features like a timer and scheduled "fact" delivery.

FactBlaster: It's like Cat Facts, but somehow more annoying!
